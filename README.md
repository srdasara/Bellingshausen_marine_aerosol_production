Variables and coding scripts used in Wind-Driven and Seasonal Effects on Marine Aerosol Production in the Bellingshausen Sea, Antarctica. As many of the variables used directly in plotting functions are too large to upload to GitHub, please email me at srdasara@ucsd.edu or at srishti.dasarathy@gmail.com for zipped versions of any files!
